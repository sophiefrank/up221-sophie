## About Me
Hi everyone! I'm Sophie and I'm a 2nd year concentrating in Design and Development. I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area :bridge_at_night: and previously graduated from UCLA with a BA in Anthropology. I then worked as an English teacher in Takasaki, Japan  for three years during which I lived car-free. This experience influenced my decision to pursue a career in urban planning and I hope to work in bicycle and pedestrian planning :bicyclist::walking: after finishing my master's this June. I have internship experience with NYCDOT and Los Angeles Walks, and I have been working as a Student Professional Worker for LADOT since the summer. In my free time I like going on walks :walking_woman:, trying new restaurants :fork_and_knife:, and visiting art museums :art:.
## Course Objectives
I have taken basic courses on QGIS and ArcGIS, but I would like to gain a much deeper understanding of GIS and be able to create beautiful, informative maps. I do not have experience with Python, so I'm also looking forward to learning this coding language and adding it to my skillset.
## Project Ideas
I'm doing my capstone on gender inclusive transportation infrastructure, so I might like to do a project analyzing the quality of active transportation infrastructure within a 10 minute walk of mobility of care destinations such as schools, daycares, and grocery stores in Los Angeles. I'd also be interested in doing a project related to street lighting, street furniture, urban tree canopy, or Vision Zero.
